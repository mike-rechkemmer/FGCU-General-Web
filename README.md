# FGCU General Web

General web design elements will be included in this documentation. The CMS FGCU uses from 2018 - 2023 uses XSLT with Bootstrap.

## FGCU Snippet Blocks

Several UI elements built using XSLT and HTML for our 400+ web editors to use:

These elements are featured pathways, usually located at the top of a page.

Quick path elements with a choice of SVG icons for clean vectors that scale cleanly on a page.

## FGCU Nav and Footer (2023 Redesign)

New leadership, a new university logo, branding updates and a refreshed color palette was introduced for the University. I took this from mockup using Figma to bring to our users for testing, to rebuilding the functionality and code. The Emerald green was incorporated more into the design and the new logo had one big rule: The logo can only be on white backgrounds.

## FGCU Nav and Footer (2021 Redesign)

We did some heatmap and user testing of the 2018 navigation and footer. Here is the design I came up with and implemented. At this time, a lot of the site was primarily blue and grays.
